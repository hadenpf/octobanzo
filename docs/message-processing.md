# Message Processing

Octobanzo's language processing system runs every message through [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai)'s detection service. Messages are not associated with your Discord username or ID, and will not be used or logged for any purpose other than Wit.ai's processing and understanding per their [Privacy Policy](https://wit.ai/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://wit.ai/terms).

### Can I opt-out of message processing?

No. Unless a server owner disables the bot's language processing function in the server you're chatting in, your message will be processed. The only way to a[void having your messages processed](message-processing.md#how-do-i-avoid-message-processing-if-i-cant-opt-out) by Octo is to avoid chatting in servers where it processes your messages.

#### Why?

Allowing users to opt-out of Octobanzo's language processing would defeat the purpose of understanding messages for purposes of moderation. If any user could exempt themselves from Octo's processing, moderation tools would not be effective.

### How do I avoid message processing if I can't opt-out?

The only way to avoid having your messages processed by Octobanzo is to avoid chatting in servers or channels where the bot processes messages.
