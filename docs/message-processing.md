# Message Processing

_While this page does convey information about legal-related topics, it is not a legal document and should not be treated as such._

Octobanzo's language processing system runs every message through [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai)'s detection service. Messages are not associated to your username or ID, and will not be used or logged for any purpose other than Wit.ai's processing per their [Privacy Policy](https://wit.ai/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://wit.ai/terms).

### Can I opt-out of message processing?

Currently, there is no opt-out function for Octobanzo's language processing, because:

* Message processing will be used to assist in moderation.

  \(e.g. detecting insulting/derogatory messages, etc.\)

* All commands are handled by NLP.

  For instance, a `!ban @spammer` command does not exist; `@Octo ban @spammer` is used instead.

As a precaution until all legal matters can be completely settled, Octobanzo is only currently being added to servers manually verified to provide disclaimers on message processing, posting warnings in clear and conspicuous places for users to see before they chat.

### How do I avoid message processing if I can't opt-out?

The only way to avoid having your messages processed by Octobanzo is to avoid chatting in servers or channels where the bot processes messages.
